# System-Report-Script

This PowerShell script can be used to produce a system health report of any Windows 7, 8, 10, Server 2008 R2, 2012 R2 in HTML format. The report can be saved locally, to a network share, or to a web portal. It can also be configured to send an email or alert when some health checks fail, and works best when added to Task Scheduler and run regularly.
